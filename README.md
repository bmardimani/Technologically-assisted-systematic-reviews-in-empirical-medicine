CS522 Project

Evidence-based Medicine is a vital part of modern health care. This methodology makes use of the systematic review articles that have summarized the evidences of a certain medication or treatment or a diagnostic test. Researchers need to search and retrieve all the information/documents that is related to a certain topic in order to write useful articles of this kind. 
In this project we make the search and retrieval process of relevant documents more efficient and optimized, using Elastic Search and we search through PubMed Central library. We perform Boolean search and use techniques to attain higher recall.
